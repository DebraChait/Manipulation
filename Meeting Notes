%% Project Meeting Notes

%% 6/25/19 Meeting
% If the curvature is very high, we could use a 2nd derivative test to
% make iterations higher ( may or may not be productive use of time?)
% - Also make plots for endp0s with same error plots
% Make p1 and p2 (-30,30) larger, and p3(-10,10) smaller (More curved rods tend to be more
% stable)
% Save ans so that we can just replot data without having to rerun code
% load command will load file
% Save trials (figure out a command)
% Method #2: Chop original and use chopped end as new boundary condition,
% repeat this process

%% 6/28/19 Meeting

% Make another 2 plots just for conj points
% Plots start p0s w conj points and then end p0's w conj points
% In one plot, plot the path of p0's and change opacity of stable and
% unstable 
% Keep a track of p0's trajectories with conjugate points
% Make random weight, extend to 4D p(0)space, try to map out
% Choose range of p0's, cycle through increasing weight

% Try first approach, take intial shape and rescale - don't update boundary
% condtion each time
% Continue cutting off ORIGINAL shape and resolve for 
% Set xf to be cuts of initial shape (don't include in loop)

%% 7/2/19 Meeting
% Loosen tolerance for straightness tests
% Pick p1 and solve BVP for set p2 and p3

% 3rd Method: No solving BVPs, move through p space
% Sample p0s, move back to orgin
% Pick a p, set lambda [0,1], These become the new IC's
% Solve IVP to find tconj
% use spherical coordinates
% discretize sphere
% Can increase more in weight (w = 0, 5, 10...)

%% 7/5/19 Meeting
% Check plots of Jacobian to check stability on paths with missing segments
% Try to just plot paths with instabilities and stable after
% Use the find funtion to find indices with jumps in path, plot just those
% in red and blue 
% If tconj is empty, nonempty, then empty plot those paths

% If you have a naturally curved rod with constant curvature, they funnel
% into  a point: -curvature/bending stiffness

% To solve BVP errors, add extensibility (see pics)
% Graph funnels to check error

%% 7/9/19 Meeting
% We can non-dimensionalize and combine parameters as a ratio
% Or just set cb = 1 and ce = high (100,000)
% Hxp is der wrt x of Hp indicies are right
% If a rod is inextensible, ce is very high

% Next try extensibility, want no BVP fails
% if that works, create funnels (conj point path plot) w/o fails 
% Run conj point path plot with legend indicating error

% Decrease number of cuts, maybe to 100
% Use extensibilty with two methods

% 7/11/19 Plans for final week
% - Sourcetree: good resource for major merge conflicts
% - Run extensible without lsfail
% - Run extensible without weight method 1 and method 2
% - Clean up data: rename files proeprly, delete unnecessary functions,
%   relabel axes in endp0 figures
% - Make slices of pspace plotting stability and instability
% - Restrict domain and run more data points

% Plots for each data set:
% - Start and end p0s by error (2 plots)
% - Start and end p0s by stability (2 plots)
% - p0 path by error (10 plots, 1 for each set of 100 points)
% - p0 path by stability (10 plots, 1 for each set of 100 points)

% Data sets:
% - w = 5, inextensible, method 1
% - w = 5, inextensible, method 2
% - w = 5, extensible, method 1
% - w = 5, extensible, method 1, no lsf
% - w = 5, extensible, method 2
% - w = 5, extensible, method 2, no lsf
% - w = 0, extensible, method 1
% - w = 0, extensible, method 1, no lsf
% - w = 0, extensible, method 2
% - w = 0, extensible, method 2, no lsf

%% Meeting 7/12/19
% Start with p0s that we know are unstable and add extensibility
% Pick a p0 that causes an upward and downward bell shape and see if that 
% leads to instabilities with ext
% Find example where adding updates is less beneficial
% scale by y^2 p_1(0), 
%          y^2 p_2(0) -w/2(1 - y^2)
%          y p_3(0)
% Run for extensible

% For LSF: Is the intial shape bad since p0 changed a lot? 
% Look at paths to determine

% Plot p0 paths
