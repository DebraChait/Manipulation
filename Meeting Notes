%% 6/25/19 Meeting
% If the curvature is very high, we could use a 2nd derivative test to
% make iterations higher ( may or may not be productive use of time?)
% - Also make plots for endp0s with same error plots
% Make p1 and p2 (-30,30) larger, and p3(-10,10) smaller (More curved rods tend to be more
% stable)
% Save ans so that we can just replot data without having to rerun code
% load command will load file
% Save trials (figure out a command)
% Method #2: Chop original and use chopped end as new boundary condition,
% repeat this process
