%% Project Meeting Notes

%% 6/25/19 Meeting
% If the curvature is very high, we could use a 2nd derivative test to
% make iterations higher ( may or may not be productive use of time?)
% - Also make plots for endp0s with same error plots
% Make p1 and p2 (-30,30) larger, and p3(-10,10) smaller (More curved rods tend to be more
% stable)
% Save ans so that we can just replot data without having to rerun code
% load command will load file
% Save trials (figure out a command)
% Method #2: Chop original and use chopped end as new boundary condition,
% repeat this process

%% 6/28/19 Meeting

% Make another 2 plots just for conj points
% Plots start p0s w conj points and then end p0's w conj points
% In one plot, plot the path of p0's and change opacity of stable and
% unstable 
% Keep a track of p0's trajectories with conjugate points
% Make random weight, extend to 4D p(0)space, try to map out
% Choose range of p0's, cycle through increasing weight

% Try first approach, take intial shape and rescale - don't update boundary
% condtion each time
% Continue cutting off ORIGINAL shape and resolve for 
% Set xf to be cuts of initial shape (don't include in loop)

%% 7/2/19 Meeting
% Loosen tolerance for straightness tests
% Pick p1 and solve BVP for set p2 and p3

% 3rd Method: No solving BVPs, move through p space
% Sample p0s, move back to orgin
% Pick a p, set lambda [0,1], These become the new IC's
% Solve IVP to find tconj
% use spherical coordinates
% discretize sphere
% Can increase more in weight (w = 0, 5, 10...)
